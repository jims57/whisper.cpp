# Acceleration Support Guide

Let me break down each acceleration support and where they can be used:

## POWER VSX Intrinsics
- For IBM POWER processors
- Used in IBM servers and workstations 
- Not for mobile or regular consumer devices

## Core ML Support
- Apple devices only
- MacOS (M1/M2 Macs)
- iOS devices (iPhones, iPads)
- Uses Apple's Neural Engine

## OpenVINO Support
- Intel processors
- Windows and Linux systems
- Not for mobile devices
- Optimized for Intel CPUs and integrated GPUs

## NVIDIA GPU Support
- Systems with NVIDIA GPUs
- Windows, Linux, MacOS (older versions)
- Not for mobile devices
- Requires CUDA toolkit

## Vulkan GPU Support
- Cross-platform GPU acceleration
- Works on most modern GPUs (NVIDIA, AMD, Intel)
- Android devices (some models)
- Not for iOS

## BLAS CPU Support via OpenBLAS
- Cross-platform CPU acceleration
- Works on most desktop/laptop CPUs
- Linux, Windows, MacOS
- Not typically used on mobile

## Ascend NPU Support
- Huawei's Neural Processing Unit
- Huawei devices and servers
- Some Huawei mobile devices
- Not for other manufacturers

## Quick Reference by Platform:
- iOS: Use Core ML
- Android: Use Vulkan  
- Mac: Use Core ML (M1/M2) or OpenBLAS (Intel)
- Windows: Use NVIDIA (if you have NVIDIA GPU) or OpenBLAS
- Linux: Use NVIDIA, OpenBLAS, or Vulkan depending on your hardware
