# SDL2 Usage Guide

SDL2 (Simple DirectMedia Layer 2) is a cross-platform development library designed to provide low-level access to audio, keyboard, mouse, joystick, and graphics hardware. It's widely used in game development and multimedia applications.

## Device Compatibility

### Desktop Operating Systems
- Ubuntu and other Linux distributions
- Windows 
- macOS

### Mobile Devices
This specific example using SDL2 is primarily designed for desktop systems.

For iOS and Android, you would need different implementations:
- iOS would typically use AVAudioEngine
- Android would use AudioRecord or other native audio APIs

## Implementation Details
The example shown in the file is specifically a desktop implementation using SDL2 for audio capture. While whisper.cpp itself can run on mobile devices, this particular real-time audio example would need to be modified to use platform-specific audio capture methods for iOS or Android.

### Mobile Implementation Options
- For iOS: Check out whisper.objc
- For Android: Use the NDK and implement audio capture using Android's native audio APIs

## Compilation Flag
The `-DWHISPER_SDL2=ON` flag specifically enables SDL2 support during compilation, which is required for this real-time audio capture example.
