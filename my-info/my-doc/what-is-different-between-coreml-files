These are two different model file formats for Whisper's encoder:

coreml-encoder-base.en.mlpackage:
- CoreML model format used on Apple devices (iOS, macOS)
- Recommended for:
  - iPhones (iPhone 8 and later with Neural Engine)
  - iPads with Neural Engine
  - Mac computers with Apple Silicon (includes Neural Engine)
  - Mac computers with Intel processors running macOS 11+ (no Neural Engine, uses CPU only)
- Contains the encoder part of Whisper base.en model
- Optimized for Apple Neural Engine (ANE)
- Even with ANE support, you may still want to include ggml-base.en-encoder.mlmodelc as a fallback:
    because:The ggml-base.en-encoder.mlmodelc file is optimized for CPU inference, while coreml-encoder-base.en.mlpackage supports Neural Engine:
  - In case CoreML initialization fails
  - For better performance testing/comparison
  - To support older iOS versions that may not fully utilize ANE

To check if a device supports CoreML:
- For iOS devices:
  - iOS 11 or later supports CoreML
  - iPhone 6s and later support CoreML
  - Check if device has Neural Engine (iPhone 8 and later)
  - Use [MLModel.compileModel(at:)] to test if model can be loaded
  - Check system info using UIDevice.current.systemVersion
  
ggml-base.en-encoder.mlmodelc:
- GGML model format used by whisper.cpp
- Contains the encoder part of Whisper base.en model
- Optimized for CPU inference
- Quantized and compressed format for efficient inference
- Used when CoreML is not available or on non-Apple devices
- Used as fallback on Apple devices if CoreML initialization fails
- Used when running on Apple devices without Neural Engine support

For iOS with CoreML support:
- You only need the CoreML model file (coreml-encoder-base.en.mlpackage)
- The GGML file is not needed when using CoreML
- whisper.cpp will automatically use the CoreML model when available on Apple devices
- CoreML models will provide better performance on iOS devices by leveraging the Neural Engine

For Android with TensorFlow Lite support:
- You only need the GGML model file (ggml-base.en-encoder.mlmodelc)
- The CoreML file is not needed when using TensorFlow Lite
- whisper.cpp will automatically use the GGML model when available on Android devices
- GGML models will provide better performance on Android devices by leveraging the CPU and GPU
