Real-time Whisper.cpp Implementation for macOS
Approach 1: Using SDL2 (Similar to Original Example)
Installation Steps
brew install sdl2
Command line options:
-m: path to the model file
-t: number of threads
--step: audio capture step in milliseconds (500ms default)
--length: audio context size in milliseconds (5000ms default)
Approach 2: Using AVFoundation (Native macOS)

Key Considerations for macOS Implementation:
Request microphone permissions at runtime
Handle audio session routing
Consider energy impact and CPU usage
Implement proper error handling
Consider accessibility features
Handle sleep/wake cycles
Consider menu bar integration options
Performance Considerations:
CPU usage monitoring
Memory management
Power consumption
Thermal throttling awareness
Activity monitoring
Background vs. foreground processing
Additional macOS Features to Consider:
Menu bar status item
Global keyboard shortcuts
System preferences integration
Notification Center widgets
Spotlight integration
Services menu integration
Background operation support
For most users, Approach 1 (SDL2) is recommended due to:
Simpler implementation
Already tested and working
Cross-platform compatibility
Minimal setup required
Official support from whisper.cpp
Choose Approach 2 (AVFoundation) if you need:
Deeper system integration
More native macOS experience
Custom UI requirements
Advanced audio processing features
Both approaches provide real-time transcription capabilities, differing mainly in integration and user experience rather than core functionality.
