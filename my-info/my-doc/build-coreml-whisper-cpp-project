Based on the CMake output, there are a few warnings but no critical errors that would prevent the build. Let's address the warnings:
CMake Version Warning:
The first warning is about CMake version compatibility. This is just a deprecation warning and not an error. To fix it, you should update the cmake_minimum_required version in the CMakeLists.txt file.
ccache Warning:
There's a warning about ccache not being found. This is optional and only affects build speed. You can install ccache if you want faster compilation:
ccache
OpenMP Warning:
OpenMP was not found, which might affect performance but won't prevent building. If you want to use OpenMP, you can install it:
libomp
The good news is that:
The build configuration completed successfully
CoreML framework was found (which is what you specifically enabled with -DWHISPER_COREML=1)
Metal framework was found
BLAS/Accelerate framework was found
You can proceed with the build by running:
build
The warnings won't prevent the project from building and running, but if you want optimal performance, you might want to install OpenMP.
relation between BLAS and Metal, should i use both?

Let me explain the relationship between BLAS and Metal in the context of whisper.cpp:
BLAS (Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms)
Traditional CPU-based optimization library
Part of Apple's Accelerate framework
Optimized for matrix/vector operations on CPU
Well-established, stable performance
Uses CPU resources
Metal
Apple's GPU programming framework
Can be significantly faster for parallel computations
Uses GPU resources
Better for large-scale matrix operations
Lower power consumption for same workload
Should you use both?
whisper.cpp is designed to automatically choose the best backend for different operations
Having both available gives the library more flexibility
Metal will be used for operations that benefit from GPU acceleration
BLAS will handle operations that are better suited for CPU
There's no conflict between them - they complement each other
Recommendation:
Keep both enabled because:
Different model sizes and operations benefit from different backends
2. The library will automatically use the most efficient backend for each operation
If you're running on a Mac, both are already part of the system (no extra installation needed)
Having both gives you the best performance across different scenarios
The only reason to disable one would be if you're trying to benchmark or specifically test one backend's performance.
